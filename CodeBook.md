## TidyAverages.txt file
The TidyAverages.txt output contains means of some of the quantities obtained from
the UCI HAR Dataset.   Each row in the dataset contains an average of a given 
variable (ex tBodyAcc-X) for all trials a subject did performing the same 
activity (ex averages of all of subject 1 LAYING trials).  Each row contains a 
subject ID number, activity name and the average
of the quantity listed at the top of each column.  The variables that are included
in the TidyAverages.txt output are listed in this file under 
**Data about motion obtained from phone**. 


##Columns in the dataset:
"Subject\_ID"   - the subject's identification number

"Activity\_Name" - the activity being performed while data was collected
